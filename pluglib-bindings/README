About namespaces:
-----------------

From swig manual:...default wrapping behavior is to flatten namespaces
in the target language. This means that the contents of all namespaces
are merged together in the resulting scripting language module....

...Because namespaces are flattened, it is possible for symbols defined
in different namespaces to generate a name conflict in the target
language. To resolve this conflict, simply use %rename to disambiguate
the declarations....
