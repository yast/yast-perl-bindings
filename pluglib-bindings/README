Supported data types:
---------------------

{signed|unsigned} {char|short|int|long|long long}
float
double
std::string

std::list (one and two level only)
std::deque (one and two level only)

namespace BLOCXX_NAMESPACE {
    (U)Int{8|16|32|64}
    Real{32|64}
    Bool
    String
    List (one and two level only)
}

* also reference and pointer to above types

About namespaces:
-----------------

From swig manual:...default wrapping behavior is to flatten namespaces
in the target language. This means that the contents of all namespaces
are merged together in the resulting scripting language module....

...Because namespaces are flattened, it is possible for symbols defined
in different namespaces to generate a name conflict in the target
language. To resolve this conflict, simply use %rename to disambiguate
the declarations....


About references and poiters:
----------------------------- 

You have to mark references and pointers to base data types (not
required for lists, maps and std::string) with variable name "REFERENCE"
(at least in header or in swig interface). For example:

void get_int(int *REFERENCE); // pointer to integer - update value
void print_str(char *str); // "black box" - only input
